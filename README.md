######CKark is an ecommerce web application for selling Computer Graphic Cards, built on Kraken.js (uses Dust Template), a layer that runs on top of Express.js that gives us special functionality as far as Security and Routing are concerned. This application uses Foundation as Responsive front-end framework with Bower as front-end package manager and the Grunt as task runner. The shopping cart is then linked with a dynamic Paypal button for transactions.
